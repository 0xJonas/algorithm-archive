# Taylor Series Expansion

I have been formally trained as a physicist. In my mind, there are several mathematical topics that blur the boundary between mathematics and physics. Taylor Series Expansions are one of those topics.

On the one hand, I can see how the expansion could be considered purely mathematical. I mean, here is the definition:
$$
T = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
$$

It looks like it is just a bunch of derivatives strung together! Where's the physics?
