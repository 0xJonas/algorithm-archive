# Taylor Series Expansion

I have been formally trained as a physicist. In my mind, there are several mathematical topics that blur the boundary between mathematics and physics. Taylor Series Expansions are one of those topics.

On the one hand, I can see how the expansion could be considered purely mathematical. I mean, here is the definition:
$$
f(x) \simeq \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
$$

It looks like it is just a bunch of derivatives strung together! Where's the physics? Well, let's expand this series for the first few derivatives

$$
f(x) \simeq a + \frac{df(a)}{da} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2f(a)}{da^2}
$$

If we substitute
