### Trees

Trees are interesting data structures to say the least. It is completely filled with *nodes*, and each node has *children* nodes within it. This means that it is naturally *recursive*. It has nodes within nodes within nodes. Because of this, it is often easier to deal with trees recursively; however, sometimes it is appropriate to transform them into other data structures for later. We'll see more of these structures growing in the loamy soil of this archive. they might seem imposing at first, but you get used to them.
