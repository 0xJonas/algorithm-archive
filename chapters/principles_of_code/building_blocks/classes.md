### Classes and Structs

A while ago, one of my friends asked me the purpose of a class. At the time, I said, "It's a useful way to store a bunch of variables in one place." He then said, "But isn't it better to explicitly state each variable?" We went back and forth for some time and ended up agreeing to disagree. There was some merit to his argument. Some languages, like Julia, forego the formality of having classes at all and instead allow users to define explicit types with additional variables inside.
