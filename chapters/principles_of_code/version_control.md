## Git and Version Control

I am a fan of open-source software. It allows users to see the nuts and bolts of their system and mess around with them if they like. 
Unlike proprietary software, the user can learn everything about the software from the ground up, and that's an incredibly exciting prospect! 
More than that, open-source development breeds strong communities of like-minded individuals who work together to solve problems they care about. At least in my case, open-source software inspired me to code in my free time. It taught me that programming is more than a simple series of instructions for a computer. More than anything, though, open-source software taught me about how to work with others and overcome petty squabbles, because if there's one thing the open-source community is known for, it's petty squabbles. 

It might be because of this that I never questioned the utility of version control. If you have a couple hundred people all contributing source code to the same place, there has to be some way to control all the different codebases individuals have on their own machines. Even if I had no collaborators, version control was a way to make sure my laptop and work machine both had the same code without having to transer a USB stick back and forth. That said, at some point in my life, I was settled in as a physics researcher. This meant that I wrote code to solve physics problems with a small team. The problem was that even though I was using version control, the rest of my team was not. 

This was frustrating. I would hear my labmates say something like, "Yeah. I rewrote my code last night and now nothing works, but I already saved over my previous version, so I'll just work with what I have." Or, "
