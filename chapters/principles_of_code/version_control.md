## Git and Version Control

I am a fan of open-source software. It allows users to see the nuts and bolts of code running on their system and mess around with it if they like. 
Unlike proprietary software, any user can learn everything about the software from the ground up, and that's an incredibly exciting prospect! 
More than that, open-source development breeds strong communities of like-minded individuals who work together to solve problems they care about. 
At least in my case, open-source software inspired me to code in my free time. It taught me that programming is more than a simple series of instructions for a computer. 
More than anything, though, open-source software taught me about how to work with others and overcome petty squabbles, because if there's one thing the open-source community is known for, it's petty squabbles. 

It might be because of my appreciation of large-scale software development that I never questioned the utility of version control. 
If you have a couple hundred people all contributing source code to the same place, there has to be some way to control all the different codebases individuals have on their own machines. 
Even if I had no collaborators, version control was a way to make sure my laptop and work machine both had the same code without having to transer a USB stick back and forth. 
That said, at some point in my life, I settled in as a physics researcher. 
This meant that I wrote code to solve physics problems with a small team. The problem was that even though I was using version control, the rest of my team was not. 

This was frustrating.
 I would hear my labmates say something like, "Yeah. I rewrote my code last night and now nothing works, but I already saved over my previous version, so I'll just work with what I have." 
Or, "I'm writing a paper with my boss. We are using Dropbox and upload files with slightly different names after we modify them. Right now, we are on paper_78c."
The point is: version control exists to control different versions of software (and other documents). 
If you are writing code, it exists as a way to quickly save what you have before making largescale modifications. 
It also allows individuals to collaborate on a larger scale by providing necessary tools to merge work created by different individuals into a single, cohesive story.

No matter how you look at it, version control is a useful and necessary tool to collaborate with other programmers and is definitely worth discussing in-depth.
Though many version control systems exist, for now we will focus on git, simply because it is incredibly popular and this book is hosted both on github and gitbook.
We hope to discuss other version control methods and strengthen the tutorial on git provided here in the future; however, this book is meant as an archive of algorithms, not as an introduction to version control or best software principles. 
For now, this tutorial is simply meant as a quick way to kickstart our community into using git and collaborating more effectively on this book. 

I feel like this introduction may have been a little too long. Let me know what you think! Regardless, now it's time to talk about git!

### Git with it!

TO DO Soon (I promise)
