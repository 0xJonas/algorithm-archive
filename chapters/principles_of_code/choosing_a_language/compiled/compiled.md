## Compiled Languages

Programming is hard because we need to write instructions for our computer. The computer then reads this set of instructions and executes them accordingly. That's the story, at least. In principle, there is more to it: *compilation*. Compilation is the act of translating what we write into something the computer can read. This is done with a *compiler*.

In this section, we will talk about all the compiled languages and discuss how to deal with different compilers and compiling options.
