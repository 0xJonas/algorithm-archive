## Choosing a Language

I have a perfectly healthy habit of personifying things. I figure a good way to properly distinguish each language from each other is to list the common ones here with a small description about their typical uses. 

**These will be updated. Feel free to let me know your favorite language and why!**

#### C/C++

#### Python

#### Julia

#### Fortran

#### CUDA

#### Java

#### Haskell
