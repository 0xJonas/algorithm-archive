# Huffman Encoding

If there were ever a data compression method to take the world by storm, it would be Huffman encoding. 
In fact, this was the method that got me into methods to begin with.
I distinctly remember sitting in my data compression class and talking about the great information theorist Claude Shannon and Robert Fano, when suddenly my professor introduced a new kid to the mix: David Huffman.
He managed to rip the heart out of the methods described by leaders of the field and create a data compression method that was easier to understand and implement, while also providing more robust results.
It was in that moment, I knew I would never amount to anything.

Anyway, I'll be updating this chapter on Huffman encoding soon with all the information you could want / need, so stay tuned!
