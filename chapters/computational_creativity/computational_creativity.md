# Computational Creativity

Alright, here's the thing: I am an awful artist. I cannot draw and I don't even listen to music so there's no inspiration to draw from there. For the most part, the only thing I have is programming. Luckily, programming *might* be the only thing I need! Recent advances in computational creativity allow scientists to make up for their apparent lack of creativity and humor with machine learning methods (among others).

This section is devoted to generating art with code. It should be interesting, at least!
