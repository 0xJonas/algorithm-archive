# Quantum Information

Quantum information theory is... intense. 
It requires a strong and fundamental understanding of classical information theory and quantum mechanics.
It is not obvious in any way and deserves many textbooks on it's own.
In fact, there are numerous textbooks on the subject already.
The purpose of this section isn't to outdo any of that fundamental knowledge.
Instead, we will attempt to distill the knowledge into a short, intuitive summary, with the hopes of helping people to understand more about the topic and pursue it further on their own.

As mentioned in the [quantum simulation](../physics_solvers/quantum/quantum.md) section, true quantum computers do not currently exist.
We do have some systems that are able to simulate qubits, but these
