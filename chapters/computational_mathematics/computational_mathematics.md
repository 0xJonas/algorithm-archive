# Computational Mathematics

There is a particular sect of programming that orbits around particular problems in mathematics that can only be addressed with the help of certain algorithms -- many of which you may already know from a mathematical course or two. In principle, these algorithms form the foundations of many other fields, and it is always difficult to make a distinction between an algorithm meant to do mathematics and an algorithm meant to do physics or some other scientific field. For this reason, I will say that any algorithm whose purpose is to calculate a mathematical quantity will belong here.

For the most part, this will include algorithms to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors and areas of computational geometry. Obviously, this section will be cleaned up as more is written.
