# Computational Physics

There is a fine line to draw between computational physics and computational mathematics. For the most part, algorithms from the two branches have grown together and work best in a relationship with each other. In some sense, I feel like a villain of sorts by separating two lovers who were obviously meant to be together. I'll get over it. 

Basically, if the sole purpose of an algorithm is to calculate some physical quantity, I'll put it here. For example, we'll be tackling the Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite-Difference (FD) and it's time-domain counterpart Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD), Dense Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and others! 

Stay tuned for more!
